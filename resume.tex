\raggedright
Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from \href{http://msrit.edu/}{MSRIT} in 2011 with a GPA of 9.09/10 and bachelor's thesis on the problems of \textit{automatic summarization} and \textit{word sense disambiguation} in the area of natural language processing and attempted to combine the concepts to produce summaries of large text corpus with greater efficacy using the \textit{Link Grammar Parser} as the part-of-speech tagger, \textit{WordNet} to find the semantic distances between words and \textit{PageRank} algorithm to find relative relatedness between words based on the semantic distance
